= Canary deployment strategy
include::_attributes.adoc[]

As mentioned before, a canary deployment is a strategy where the operator releases a new version of their application to a small percentage of the production traffic. This small percentage may test the new version and provide feedback. If the new version is working well the operator may increase the percentage, till all the traffic is using the new version.

== Generate film-storage APP GitOps Deployment Model

First of all, it is required to review a set of objects in our forked git repository to configure the deployment correctly for deploying our application following a GitOps model.

Please follow the next section to understand the required objects and configurations.

[#04-review]
=== Review and Modify Rollout strategy

As you know so well, the Rollout object controls the application deployment. If you look closely, it is possible to find many similarities between an Argo Rollout object and a Kubernetes Deployment. The main difference between the previous objects referenced is the rollout strategy field. 

Please edit the file named *./canary/film-storage-rollout.yaml* to define **<TIME>** as *30s* and understand the canary deployment strategy:

[source,yaml,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
  strategy:
    canary:
      analysis:
        startingStep: 1
        templates:
        - templateName: film-storage-analysis-template
      steps:
      - setWeight: 10
      - pause:
          duration: <TIME>
      - setWeight: 50
      - pause:
          duration: <TIME>

[#04-mod]
=== Modify Analysis Template 

Please edit the file named *./canary/film-storage-analysis-template.yaml* to add the required **<USERNAME>** that helps to reference the user namespace in the healthcheck URL.

[source,yaml,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
  metrics:

=== Commit and Push the Changes

Once all the files are configured correctly, it is time to commit and push all changes to the repository that you have just forked.

== Deploy film-storage ArgoCD Application

We are going to create the application *film-storage-canary*, which we will use to test canary deployment. Because we will make changes in the application's GitHub repository, we have to use the repository that you have just forked. Please edit the following .yaml file, and set your own GitHub repository in the *repoURL*. Create a file called *film-storage-canary.yaml* inside the argocd folder:

[.console-input]
[source,input,yaml,subs="+macros,+attributes"]

Looking at the Argo CD dashboard, you would notice that we have a new *film-storage* application.

[#04-app]
== Application architecture

To achieve canary deployment with *Cloud Native* applications using **Argo Rollouts**, we have designed this architecture.

image::canary-rollout-step-0.png["Dstrategies initial status"]

OpenShift Components - Online

- Routes and Services
- Services mapped to the rollout.

In Blue/Green deployment we always have an offline service to test the version that is not in production. In the case of canary deployment, we do not need it because progressively we will have the new version in production. 

We can also see the rollout's status.

When a new version is deployed, **Argo Rollouts** creates a new revision (ReplicaSet). The number of replicas in the new release increases based on the information in the steps, and the number of replicas in the old release decreases by the same number. We have configured a pause duration between each step. To learn more about **Argo Rollouts**, please read https://argoproj.github.io/argo-rollouts/features/canary/[this].

[#04-test]
== Test film-storage application
 
We have deployed the *film-storage* with ArgoCD. We can test that it is up and running.
 
To test the online service, you can use URL:

[.console-input]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
curl -s "$(oc get routes film-storage -n {user}-canary --template='http://{{.spec.host}}')/api/v1/info"
----

TIP: You can use the ```watch``` command to make requests every 2 seconds.

[#04-canary]
== film-storage canary deployment

We have split a *Cloud Native* Canary deployment into three automatic steps:

1. Deploy canary version for 10%
2. Scale the canary version to 50%
3. Scale the canary version to 100%

This is just an example. The key point here is that very easily we can have the canary deployment that better fits our needs. To make this demo faster we have not set a pause without duration in any step, so  **Argo Rollouts** will go throw each step automatically.

To test canary deployment we are going to do changes in the application.

[#04-step1]
### Step 1 - Deploy the canary version for 10%
 
We will deploy a new version *V2.0.0*. To do it, we have to edit the files *./canary/film-storage-rollout.yaml* to modify the value *0.2* to *0.3*:

[.console-input]
[source,input,yaml,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
          image: quay.io/dborrego/film-storage:0.3 <---
----
[.console-input]

Before applying these changes, it is important to monitor the current version. To track all canary processes, it is required to the following command to make a request every 500ms

[.console-input]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
watch -n0.5 curl -s "$(oc get routes film-storage -n {user}-canary --template='http://{{.spec.host}}')/api/v1/info"
----

**Argo Rollouts** will automatically deploy a new film-storage revision. The canary version will be 10% of the replicas. In this demo, we are not using https://argoproj.github.io/argo-rollouts/features/traffic-management/[traffic management]. **Argo Rollouts** makes a best-effort attempt to achieve the percentage listed in the last setWeight step between the new and old version. This means that it will create only one replica in the new revision because it is rounded up. All the requests are load balanced between the old and the new replicas.

Push the changes to start the deployment.
[.console-input]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
git add .
git commit -m "Change film-storage to version 0.3"
git push
----

ArgoCD will refresh the status after some minutes. If you don't want to wait you can refresh it manually from ArgoCD UI.

----

If we make a lot of requests, we will have the new version in *25%* of the requests.

[#04-step2]
### Step 2 - Scale the canary version to 50%

After 30 seconds **Argo Rollouts** automatically will increase the number of replicas in the new release to 2. Instead of increasing automatically after 30 seconds, we can configure **Argo Rollouts** to wait indefinitely until that *Pause* condition is removed. But this is not part of this demo.

### Step 3 - Scale the canary version to 100%

After another 30 seconds, **Argo Rollouts** will increase the number of replicas in the new release to 4 and scale down the old revision.
